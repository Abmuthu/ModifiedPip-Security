<Purpose>
  Provides a wrapper for any command of the software supply chain.

  The wrapper performs the following tasks which are implemented in this
  library.

    - Record state of material (files the command is executed on)
    - Execute command
      - Capture stdout/stderr/return value of the executed command
    - Record state of product (files after the command was executed)
    - Return link object
        can be used to sign and dump
